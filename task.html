        <h1>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h1>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
                     thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National YouthAdministration</li>
                <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
                    Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
                    how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
                    budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to
                    study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
                    pest-resistant plants.</li>
                <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
                    pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
                    program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
                    different strains of disease-resistant wheat - including different
                    varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
                <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding
                    American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes
                    on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li>2005 - states "We will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
                    Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                    we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
                    crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
                    modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
                    science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>

            <q>Borlaug's life and
                achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's
                towering intellect, persistence, and scientific vision can make to human
                peace and progress.</q>
